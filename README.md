The project focuses on analyzing user ride activity data from Metrocar, a ride-sharing app similar to Uber. The objective is to understand and optimize the sales funnel for users who downloaded the app in 2021, thereby improving revenue and user engagement.

Key Highlights:

Data Aggregation and Analysis: The project involves aggregating and analyzing data using SQL and creating a sales funnel in Tableau. The data set comprises information about app downloads, user sign-ups, ride requests, financial transactions, and driver reviews.

User Funnel Analysis: The user funnel tracks the journey from app download to ride review. Notable drop-offs occur between app download and sign-up, and between ride request and ride completion. Recommendations include improving the app's landing page and addressing issues related to ride requests.

Ride Funnel Analysis: The ride funnel examines the trajectory of rides from request to review. The primary drop-off is observed between rides requested and rides accepted. Strategies to reduce this drop-off include implementing price surging during peak hours.

Target Audience Identification: Users aged 35 to 44, primarily on iOS devices, are identified as the most frequent riders. Recommendations focus on engaging this group and expanding to users aged 25 to 34.

In conclusion, the project offers insights into Metrocar's sales funnel, identifies areas for improvement, and provides actionable recommendations to enhance user engagement and revenue generation.



This project aids Metrocar in making data-driven decisions and optimizing its business strategy for the future.
